# Roman_Numbers_Converter
This is my FIRST programme, created in my freshman year.

Based on C language, with some simple *switch-case* statements.

Only arabic number in the [1, 4000) interval is supported, since there is no Roman Number for nonpositive numbers or 5000, .etc.

If any bug is found, please point out.
